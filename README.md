# PCA-implementation
I built an algorithm that recognizes if a face belongs to a given dataset. 
Training phase: The images are transormed in arrays, then  
I used one of the most effective dimensionality reduction technique: Principal component analysis (PCA). Firstly, the eigenvectors of the Covariance matrix have to be found and only some of them are chosen in order to get the principal components. Then the faces are projected in the subspace of these principal components. 
Test phase: chosen a threshold, given a new image, this is compared to the average face and if the distance between this and the subspace generated by the eigenfaces is lower than the threshold, the algorithm recognize the face.
